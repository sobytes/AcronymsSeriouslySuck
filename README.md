### Procedures:

Recently started working for a larger company after working for myself for a while and was completely snowed under with Acronyms and it is embarrassing to ask. Needed to brush up on ReactJS and ExpressJS so built this as a little side project.

acronymsseriouslysuck.com

Simple concept has a Chrome extension that searches the page for Acronyms from a DB you create and then gives you more info on them. Happy for any suggestions to make this better putting it out there. üëçüèª
